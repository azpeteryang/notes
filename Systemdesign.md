# Networks and Protocols       
* IP - Internet Protocol
* TCP - Transmission Control Protocol      
* HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol      

# Storage, Latency and Throughput      
* Storage: "Disk storage" is persistent storage, "Memory storage" is temporary storage;      
* Latency: Reading from memory is much faster than reading form disk.      
* Throughput: The amount of data that can be pass in a unit of time, the way to increase the throughput is to increase the bottleneck of the system.           

# System Availability            
* Quantifying Availability: the percentage of time that the system's primary functionality and operations are available in a period of time.     
* SLAs: Service Level Agreements/ Assurances      
* Designing HA: Design a high availability (HA) system by designing 'redundancy' into the system.
